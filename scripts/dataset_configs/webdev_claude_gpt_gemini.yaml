  Each model is given a user prompt to generate a web development project.

  When looking for interesting properties of responses, consider the following (note these are not exhaustive):
  1. **Code Quality**: Correctness, best practices, security vulnerabilities, and adherence to modern web standards
  2. **Completeness**: Whether the implementation fully addresses the user's requirements and includes necessary dependencies
  3. **User Experience**: UI/UX quality, accessibility, responsiveness, and visual appeal
  4. **Maintainability**: Code organization, documentation, comments, and readability
  5. **Functionality**: Whether the code would actually work as intended, proper error handling, and edge case coverage
  6. **Performance**: Efficient implementations, loading times, and resource usage
  7. **Stylistic Choices**: The model's choices in terms of language, formatting, layout, and style. For example, choosing things like specific color palettes, shape, font, or icon choices.
  8. **User interpretation**: If given vauge instructions, what design choices does the model make to try to fulfill the user's requirements?
