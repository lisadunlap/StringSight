task_description: |
  This task is answering Olympiad level math questions.

  When looking for interesting properties of responses, consider the following (note these are not exhaustive):
  1. Factuality: correctness about math concepts, formulas, and problem-solving
  2. Problem approach: how the model approaches the problem, what plans it makes, what theorems or lemmas it uses, etc
  3. Errors: errors in reasoning, interpretation of the problem, computation, logical inconsistencies, etc
  4. Layout: the structure of the response, formatting, notation
  5. Reasoning: how the model reasons about each step of the problem, how it checks its work, etc
